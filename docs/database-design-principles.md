Database design is the process of structuring a database to ensure data is stored efficiently, consistently, and securely. Good design improves performance, reduces redundancy, and supports future growth.

1. Principle of Normalization

Organize data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

Follow normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).

Example: Instead of storing author details repeatedly in the Books table, create a separate Authors table and link via foreign key.

2. Principle of Data Integrity

Ensure accuracy and consistency of data.

Use constraints:

PRIMARY KEY: Unique identifier for each row.

FOREIGN KEY: Ensures referential integrity between tables.

UNIQUE: Prevent duplicate values.

NOT NULL: Column cannot be empty.

CHECK: Enforce valid values.

3. Principle of Simplicity

Keep table structures simple and intuitive.

Avoid unnecessary complexity; each table should represent one entity.

Example: Separate Books and Members rather than combining into a single table.

4. Principle of Scalability

Design tables to handle future growth without redesigning the database.

Use modular tables and relationships rather than storing all data in one table.

Example: Use a BorrowedBooks table to track multiple book loans instead of adding multiple columns in Members.

5. Principle of Flexibility

Database should accommodate changes in business requirements.

Use foreign keys, indexes, and views to adapt without major redesign.

Example: Adding a new genre column to the Books table without affecting existing queries.

6. Principle of Performance

Optimize for common queries and operations.

Use indexes for columns that are frequently searched or joined.

Avoid excessive joins if performance is critical.

Example: Index author_id in Books to speed up author lookups.

7. Principle of Redundancy Avoidance

Avoid storing the same data in multiple places.

Reduces errors and update anomalies.

Example: Store author details in Authors table instead of repeating in every book record.

8. Principle of Security

Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.

Implement:

User permissions (READ, WRITE, UPDATE, DELETE)

Access control per table or column

Example: Limit access to Membersâ€™ contact info to authorized staff only.

9. Principle of Consistency

Ensure data rules and relationships are consistently applied.

Use constraints, triggers, and transactions to enforce rules.

Example: Prevent borrowing a book that is already checked out using constraints or transaction checks.

10. Principle of Documentation

Maintain clear documentation for tables, relationships, and business rules.

Helps developers, analysts, and DBAs understand the database structure.
