1. First client enters a website name in the browsers address bar.

2.DNS(Domain Name System) translates the domain (e.g example.com) into the server's IP address

3.The browser sends a HTTP GET request to the server's IP address

4.The server receives the request processes it,and generates response.The server might also use database or fetch data from external service based on the request.

5.The server sends the response (could be HTML,file,JSON,etc) back to the client.

6.The client(browser) renders the response for the user to view.


HTTP VS HTTPS

>>HTTP STANDS FOR HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL AND IS USED FOR TRANSMITTING DATA OVER THE WEB.


>>IT DEFINES HOW REQUESTS AND RESPONSES SHOULD LOOK AND HOW SERVER SHOULD HANDLE THEM.

>>HTTPS IS THE SECURE VERSION OF HTTP,USING SSL/TLS EXCRYPTION TO PROTECT DATA DURING TRANSMISSION.

>>THE BROWSER SENDS AN HTTP/HTTPS REQUEST TO THE SERVER FOR A SPECIFIC RESOURCE(EG: WEBPAGE,IMAGE)

>>THERE ARE DIFFERENT HTTP METHODS LIKE GET,POST,PUT,PATCH,ETC
