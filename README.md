     These are my learning goals for the 8-week full stack program.

Version Control: Learn Git & GitHub workflow, deploy fullstack applications to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Render, or Heroku, and share live projects.

Code Quality & Tools: Use ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged, and commitlint to maintain clean, consistent, and professional code.

Frontend (React): Build dynamic user interfaces using React, JSX, components, props, state, hooks, and React Router. Handle forms, API calls, and state management using Context API.

Backend (Node.js & Express): Develop RESTful APIs with Express, implement routing, middleware, and error handling. Structure backend projects efficiently.

Databases:
SQL/PostgreSQL: Learn relational database design, SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and connect Express to PostgreSQL for CRUD operations.

MongoDB & Mongoose: Learn NoSQL database concepts, CRUD operations, schema modeling, and integrating MongoDB with Express.

Fullstack Integration: Connect React frontend with Express backend, handle API requests using Axios/Fetch, manage environment variables, and implement authentication.

Deployment:Deploy fullstack applications to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Render, or AWS, and share live projects.
